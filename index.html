					<h4>
						Make Their Day Unforgettable
					</h4>
					<p>
					<!-- Don’t let your loved one’s special day pass by like any ordinary day.--> 
					Give them a gift that will make their day that they will never forget for the rest of their life.
					</p>

					<h4>
					Think Different
					</h4>
					<p>
						Why give someone you love a common item that you can buy at any store, when you can get a really cool and unique present.
						<!-- that also creates a lasting memory? Arts reflect a feeling, so don’t just give a gift, give a feeling!-->
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="home-ele">		
					<h4>
						Long Lasting
					</h4>
					<p>
						<!--The sketch will probably hang on their wall or some other noticeable place. Then,--> 
						Every time your loved one looks at their sketch, they will remember that you had given them a really priceless gift.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="home-ele">		
					<h4>
						Unexpected Gift
					</h4>
					
					<p>
						<!--If you really want to surprise your loved one, then-->
						Gift them their sketch which they would least expect it.
						<!-- Your loved one will not have the words to describe their feelings.-->
						You will see the delight in their eyes!
					</p>
					<br>	
				</div>
				<div class="home-ele">
					<h4>
						Art Elicits Emotion
					</h4>
					
					<p>
						Arts reflect a feeling, so don’t just give a gift, give a feeling!
						<!--Whenever a recipient sees their sketch, however, they will feel the same emotion that they felt after seeing their sketch first time. This feeling will make them remember that you provided them such a wonderful and lasting gift.-->
					</p>
						
				</div>	
				<div class="home-ele">
					<h4>
						No Specific Age Group
					</h4>
					
					<p>
					<!--Unlike many other gifts, a portrait sketch is not limited to a girlfriend or boyfriend. -->
					You can give it as a gift to any of your loved ones: parents, siblings, relatives, etc. 
					<!--The memory will never fade and recipients of all ages will love it!-->
